# 📝 Programming II – PartialExam-POO-2025-02-B

## Context
You are hired to develop a simple system for a university.  
The system must manage students.  
Read the UML diagram and implement it in **Java** using encapsulation and overloaded constructors.

## UML Diagram
👉 [View UML Diagram](https://www.rapidcharts.ai/editor/a371fd68-e5fc-4daf-9a89-e64c5efabca5/View)

## Instructions
1. Implement the `Student` class as in the UML diagram.  
2. All attributes must be **private**.  
3. Use **getters and setters** where necessary.  
4. Implement the **three constructors** (default, with name+age, with name+age+id).  
5. Implement the method `showInfo()`.  
6. In a `Main` class, create at least **two Student objects** using different constructors and test the method `showInfo()`.

## Reflection Question
Write a short paragraph (5–8 sentences) in English:  
👉 *How did you apply your own learning strategies to solve this exam? Mention one difficulty and how you solved it.*

## The tools used, in my case, were audiovisual aids. In my case, YouTube was the one that
## helped me understand a little more about the things covered in class. It also helped me understand code cases.
## Also, although AI sounds a little bad, thanks to her voice, she explained how some things about getters and setters worked, 
## as well as constructors. In my case, I used most of the help through videos,
## which helped me understand it.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **UML implementation in Java (attributes, constructors, methods):** 50%  
- **Objects created and tested in `Main`:** 20%  
- **Reflection** 30%
